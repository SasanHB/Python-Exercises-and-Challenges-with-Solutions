# Exercise 01: Display numbers from a list using loop
"""
Write a program to display only those numbers from a list that satisfy the following conditions

-The number must be divisible by five
-If the number is greater than 150, then skip it and move to the next number
-If the number is greater than 500, then stop the loop

Given:
numbers = [12, 75, 150, 180, 145, 525, 50]

Expected output:
75
150
145

# Exercise 02: Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
"""
Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

Examples:
6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.

Given:
# range
start = 25
end = 50

Expected output:
Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
29
31
37
